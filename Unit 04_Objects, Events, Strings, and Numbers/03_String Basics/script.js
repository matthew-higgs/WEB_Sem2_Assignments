Jesus, I am overjoyed to meet you face to face
You've been getting quite a name all around the place
Healing cripples, raising from the dead
And now, I understand you're God
At least, that's what you've said

So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're divine - change my water into wine
That's all you need do, and I'll know it's all true
C'mon, king of the Jews!

Jesus, you just won't believe the hit you've made round here
You are all we talk about, the wonder of the year!
Oh, what a pity if it's all a lie
Still, I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you try

So, you are the Christ, you're the great Jesus Christ
Prove to me that you're no fool - walk across my swimming pool
If you do that for me, then I'll let you go free
C'mon, king of the Jews!

I only ask things I'd ask any superstar
What is it that you have got that puts you where you are?
I am waiting, yes, I'm a captive fan
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man

So, if you are the Christ, yes, the great Jesus Christ
Feed my household with this bread - you can do it on your head!
Or has something gone wrong? Why do you take so long?
C'mon, king of the Jews!

Hey! Aren't you scared of me Christ? Mr Wonderful Christ!
You're a joke, you're not the Lord
You are nothing but a fraud
Take him away - he's got nothing to say!

Get out, you king of the Jews! Get out of my life!
