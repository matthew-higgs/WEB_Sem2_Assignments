        She comes in colours everywhere<br>
        She combs her hair<br>
        She's like a rainbow<br>
        Coming, colours in the air<br>
        Everywhere<br>
        She comes in colours<br>
        She comes in colours everywhere<br>
        She combs her hair<br>
        She's like a rainbow<br>
        Coming, colours in the air<br>
        Oh, everywhere<br>
        She comes in colours<br>
        Have you seen her dressed in blue?<br>
        See the sky in front of you<br>
        And her face is like a sail<br>
        Speck of white, so fair and pale<br>
        Have you seen a lady fairer?<br>
        She comes in colours everywhere<br>
        She combs her hair<br>
        She's like a rainbow<br>
        Coming, colours in the air<br>
        Hm, everywhere<br>
        She comes in colours<br>
        Have you seen her all in gold?<br>
        Like a queen in days of old<br>
        She shoots colours all around<br>
        Like a sunset going down<br>
        Have you seen a lady fairer?<br>
        She comes in colours everywhere<br>
        She combs her hair<br>
        She's like a rainbow<br>
        Coming, colours in the air<br>
        Oh, everywhere<br>
        She comes in colours<br>
        She's like a rainbow<br>
        Coming, colours in the air<br>
        Oh, everywhere<br>
        She comes in colours
